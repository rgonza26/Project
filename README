~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ To get the site running please follow this steps:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


1. - First thing to do is install Rails in the computer you are using. 

(If you already have Rails go to Step 2).

Great steps on how to install rails can be found here:
http://installrails.com/steps/choose_os



2. - After you install Rails you have to change your directory to the project folder.
	Open Terminal or CMD and cd to CSE360Secondary


3. - You will also need to run the following commands just to get the project running.
	$ bundle install	
	$ rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
	


4. - Once you complete step 3 you can run the rails server.
      Type in Terminal or CMD
	$ rails server

5. - Go to the Web Browser of your choice and type the following web address.
      
      http://localhost:3000/
      

6. - After that you should be able to see our amazing website.
